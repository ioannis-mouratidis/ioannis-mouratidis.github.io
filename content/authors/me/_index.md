## About Me

I am a machine learning and genomics researcher with 33 publications (10 first-/corresponding-author) currently working at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on developing computational and machine learning methods for large-scale genomic data analysis, with particular emphasis on genomic foundation models, k-mer based approaches, and AI applications in cancer detection.

I co-founded Neomer Diagnostics, an AI-driven cancer biomarker startup, and have authored grants securing over $4M in competitive funding. My work spans algorithm design, database development, and the creation of open-source bioinformatics tools including kmerDB and Zseeker.

I lead a 5-member research team and am passionate about mentoring junior researchers, having supervised 8+ researchers and mentored 5 to their first lead-author publications.
