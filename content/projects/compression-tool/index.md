## Overview

A novel compression tool developed in C++ and Python specifically optimized for multiple genomic file formats. This tool significantly reduces storage requirements while dramatically improving compression speed compared to existing solutions.

## Performance

- **10-20% smaller file sizes** compared to standard genomic compression tools
- **50-70% faster compression times** enabling real-time analysis
- **Multiple format support**: Handles various genomic data formats
- **Lossless compression**: Maintains data integrity for scientific applications

## Technical Approach

The tool leverages domain-specific knowledge about genomic data structure to achieve superior compression ratios and speeds. Implementation in C++ provides low-level performance optimization while Python bindings enable easy integration into bioinformatics pipelines.

## Impact

This compression tool enables:
- Reduced storage costs for large-scale genomic projects
- Faster data transfer and backup operations
- Real-time compression for sequencing pipelines
- More efficient cloud-based genomic analysis

## Applications

- Large-scale sequencing projects
- Genomic data archiving
- Cloud-based bioinformatics platforms
- Real-time sequencing data processing
