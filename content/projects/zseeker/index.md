## Overview

Zseeker is an open-source Python tool designed for optimized detection of Z-DNA forming sequences in large genomic datasets. Z-DNA is an alternative left-handed DNA structure implicated in gene regulation, genome instability, and various biological processes.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized algorithms enable analysis of entire genomes
- **Accuracy**: Improved detection accuracy compared to previous methods
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale genomic datasets
- **Easy to Use**: Simple Python interface with clear documentation
- **Open Source**: Freely available for academic and commercial use

## Technical Details

Zseeker implements advanced algorithms for identifying sequences capable of forming Z-DNA structures based on sequence composition and thermodynamic properties. The tool is optimized for both speed and accuracy, making it suitable for genome-wide analyses.

## Use Cases

- Genome-wide Z-DNA mapping
- Regulatory element identification
- Genome stability studies
- Comparative genomics of non-B DNA structures
- Disease-associated variant analysis
