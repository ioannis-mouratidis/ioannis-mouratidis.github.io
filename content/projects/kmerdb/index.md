## Overview

kmerDB is a comprehensive database that consolidates genomic and proteomic k-mer sequence information across all species in Genbank and UniProt. This resource enables rapid species identification, comparative genomic studies, and evolutionary analysis.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Encompasses k-mer data from all species in major sequence databases
- **Dual Coverage**: Includes both genomic (DNA) and proteomic (amino acid) sequences
- **Fast Queries**: Optimized data structures enable rapid k-mer lookups
- **Species Identification**: Enables efficient molecular diagnostics and species authentication
- **100-fold Compression**: Novel compression procedures reduce data storage requirements dramatically

## Technical Implementation

The database was built using advanced compression algorithms achieving 100-fold data reduction while maintaining query performance. This enables storage and analysis of k-mer information from the entire tree of life.

## Applications

- Species identification and authentication
- Comparative genomics
- Evolutionary studies
- Molecular diagnostics
- Environmental monitoring
- Food authentication
