## Overview

Co-founded Neomer Diagnostics in 2022 as Chief Technical Officer to translate patented nullomer research into a clinical cancer detection platform. The company developed machine learning pipelines for detecting cancer from liquid biopsies.

## Role & Achievements

As CTO, I:
- Developed ML pipeline in Bash, Julia, Python, and Slurm for cancer detection from liquid biopsies
- Achieved AUC ranging from 0.89 to 0.94 in lung and ovarian cancers
- Established regulatory roadmap for clinical validation and FDA approval
- Secured $850K in translational research funding
- Led technical team and coordinated with clinical partners

## Technology

The platform leveraged sequences absent from the human genome (nullomers) as biomarkers for cancer detection. Machine learning models were trained on cell-free DNA and RNA data from liquid biopsies to distinguish cancer patients from healthy controls.

## Clinical Applications

- Early cancer detection
- Cancer screening in high-risk populations
- Monitoring treatment response
- Detecting minimal residual disease

## Funding & Recognition

- Secured $850K in translational research funding
- Patent portfolio covering nullomer-based diagnostics
- Partnerships with clinical institutions

## Period

January 2022 - May 2023
