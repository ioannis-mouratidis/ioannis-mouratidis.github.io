abstract: Cancer detection using liquid biopsies represents a paradigm shift in early diagnosis. This study leverages sequences missing from the human genome (nullomers) to develop a novel approach for cancer detection and diagnosis.

summary: Developed a novel cancer detection method using sequences absent from the human genome, demonstrating potential for liquid biopsy-based diagnostics.
